# Yelp API For Node.JS

In this project, I am accessing the Yelp API to retrieve business information.

1.  Search By ID (yelp_id)

1.  Search By Match (Name, Address)

1.  Search New Businesses (Category, Location)

You will need to get Authorization from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3).
